a)  Making of the Project

  1)  The outer body has been 3D Printed and the material used was Polylactic Acid (PLA).
  2)  Since, this was an exhibition project, only 30 percent infill was used.
  3)  The design for the body was picked from a website named thingiverse.
  4)  Nylon Strings and Fishing Line was used to hold the 3D Printed pieces together.
  5)  Inside the arm, Arduino UNO, DC-DC Buck Converter, Lithium Rechargable Batteries, two Servo Motors, and 0.96 Oled was used.
  6)  Buck Converter was used to limited the voltages coming from the batteries, otherwise, the arduino would have fried.
  7)  The fishing line was attached to two servo motors which were controlled using the arduino (2 Fingers, 3 Fingers).
  8)  When the push button was pressed, the servo motors would rotate according to the appropriate mode.


b)  Project Information
  1)  This project is called BH v1.0. BH stands for bionic hand. This was initially designed for child amputees.
  2)  We configured 4 Modes in this, 2 fingers were attached to one servo motor and the other 3 were attached to the second motor.
  3)  The video can demonstrate the working for you.
  4)  This project has been coded in the arduino language in its entirely.
